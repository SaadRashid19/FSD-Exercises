                <h3>Advanced Automated Parking Lot Management System</h3>
                <p>This project presents the design and development of an Automated Parking Lot Management 
System that optimizes vehicle parking in limited spaces using embedded technology. The 
system is built on an ESP32 microcontroller platform and incorporates servo motors, infrared 
(IR) sensors, and an OLED display. The primary objective of this project is to create a user
friendly interface for managing parking slots, where users can add, search, and remove 
vehicles with ease. <br> <br>
 
The system includes four parking slots and separate entry and exit barriers, each operated by 
servo motors. Upon selecting an operation, users are prompted to input a car number, and the 
system processes the input to either allocate or release a parking slot. Entry and exit barriers 
open and close automatically through IR proximity sensors, minimizing manual intervention. 
The OLED display provides real-time updates on parking availability, displaying messages 
such as "Welcome, project by Saad & Prasiddha" or "Parking is full." When a slot becomes 
available, the system automatically reverts to the welcome message.<br> <br>
 
The project demonstrates effective use of IoT components to automate parking management, 
offering a scalable solution for real-world applications where space efficiency and 
automation are critical. This system is designed to improve user convenience, reduce traffic 
congestion within parking areas, and promote efficient space utilization.</p>

                <h3>Stats Based Football Scouting</h3>
                <p>In this project, a comprehensive database system has been developed to facilitate football 
scouting by capturing key player statistics from various sources. Using MySQL, this system 
organizes and stores data in different tables, each focused on a specific aspect of player 
performance. The data is then analyzed and visualized to support informed decision-making in 
scouting. The system enables the application of multiple filters and criteria to assess player 
suitability for different playing styles, offering a powerful tool for teams and analysts to 
identify the most suitable players for their specific tactical needs. <br> <br>
The project leverages Python and MySQL for database management and data manipulation, 
with additional tools such as Pandas for data processing and Tkinter for building a graphical 
user interface (GUI). By inputting player data from CSV files, the system organizes the 
information in various relational tables, including match statistics, shot efficiency, passing 
stats, defensive stats, and more. Through this interface, users can dynamically filter players 
based on specific performance criteria, such as passing accuracy, tackling, dribbling success, 
and aerial duels won, which can then guide the selection process for football teams. <br> <br>
In summary, this project aims to enhance the scouting process by automating the extraction 
and analysis of player statistics, providing valuable insights to teams and scouts looking for 
players who fit particular roles or playing styles. By leveraging a comprehensive database 
system and data visualization techniques, this project offers a modern approach to football 
scouting, shifting the focus from traditional subjective evaluations to data-driven decision
making.</p>
